# Car_Damage_detector_MRCNN
    The aim of this project is to detect damages in the car that can be used by car rental or insurance companies for faster processing.
    The dataset used is Coco Car Damage Detection Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/lplenka/coco-car-damage-detection-dataset.  
    The model is developed using MRCNN library as base and custom config and load_dataset classes to config the training and preparing the datasets respectively. 
    I have used Google Colab to train the model and used mAP as evaluation metrics.
